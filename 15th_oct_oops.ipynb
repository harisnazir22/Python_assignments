       "'Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new \\n   class (derived or child class) based on an existing class (base or parent class). The derived class inherits the\\n   attributes and behaviors (methods) of the parent class. In Python, this relationship between classes is established\\n   using the class definition and the super() function.\\n\\n          Significance of inheritance in object-oriented programming:\\n\\n1.Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing you to define common attributes and methods in a base\\n  class and then create multiple derived classes that inherit these attributes and methods. This reduces code duplication\\n  and helps maintainability.\\n\\n2.Hierarchical Organization: Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchical structure of classes. You can have a base\\n  class at the top and multiple levels of derived classes beneath it. This hierarchical organization models relationships\\n  and concepts more effectively.\\n\\n3.Extensibility: You can extend the functionality of existing classes by adding new attributes and methods in derived\\n  classes. This promotes modularity and makes it easier to add or modify features without affecting the base class.\\n\\n4.Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, where objects of derived classes can be treated as objects of their\\n  parent class. This allows you to create more generic code that works with a variety of objects without needing to\\n  know their specific derived types.\\n\\n5.Specialization: You can create specialized classes that inherit from more general classes. This enables you to model\\n  specific behaviors and attributes for specialized objects while benefiting from the common features defined in the\\n  base class.\\n\\n6.Easy Maintenance: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and update code. Changes made to the base class are\\n  automatically inherited by all derived classes. This reduces the risk of inconsistencies and simplifies maintenance.\\n\\n7.Abstraction: By defining a base class with abstract methods and attributes, you can enforce certain behavior and\\n  characteristics in derived classes. This encourages a structured and consistent design.\\n\\n8.Code Organization: Inheritance helps organize code into logical and meaningful groupings. It reflects the natural\\n  relationships and hierarchies in the problem domain, making code more intuitive and understandable.'"

    "          Significance of inheritance in object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing you to define common attributes and methods in a base\n",
    "  class and then create multiple derived classes that inherit these attributes and methods. This reduces code duplication\n",
    "  and helps maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Hierarchical Organization: Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchical structure of classes. You can have a base\n",
    "  class at the top and multiple levels of derived classes beneath it. This hierarchical organization models relationships\n",
    "  and concepts more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Extensibility: You can extend the functionality of existing classes by adding new attributes and methods in derived\n",
    "  classes. This promotes modularity and makes it easier to add or modify features without affecting the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, where objects of derived classes can be treated as objects of their\n",
    "  parent class. This allows you to create more generic code that works with a variety of objects without needing to\n",
    "  know their specific derived types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Specialization: You can create specialized classes that inherit from more general classes. This enables you to model\n",
    "  specific behaviors and attributes for specialized objects while benefiting from the common features defined in the\n",
    "  base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Easy Maintenance: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and update code. Changes made to the base class are\n",
    "  automatically inherited by all derived classes. This reduces the risk of inconsistencies and simplifies maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Abstraction: By defining a base class with abstract methods and attributes, you can enforce certain behavior and\n",
    "  characteristics in derived classes. This encourages a structured and consistent design.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Code Organization: Inheritance helps organize code into logical and meaningful groupings. It reflects the natural\n",
    "  relationships and hierarchies in the problem domain, making code more intuitive and understandable.'''"

    "'''Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes\n",
    "to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables you to write more generic and reusable code by providing\n",
    "a way to work with objects in a uniform and consistent manner, regardless of their specific types. Polymorphism is\n",
    "closely related to the following OOP principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Polymorphism relies on class inheritance. When multiple classes share a common base class, they can exhibit\n",
    "polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Polymorphism abstracts the specific details of objects and focuses on their common attributes and\n",
    "behaviors, promoting high-level thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Polymorphism often involves encapsulation, as objects provide a controlled interface (methods) to\n",
    "interact with their data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is typically achieved in Python through method overriding and dynamic binding.\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Overriding: Subclasses can provide their own implementation for methods that are inherited from a base class.\n",
    "This allows a method to have different behaviors in different subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Binding: When a method is called on an object, Python determines at runtime which method implementation to invoke\n",
    "based on the actual type of the object. This allows you to treat objects of different classes as if they were objects \n",
    "of a common base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck typing: This is a dynamic typing system that allows us to call methods on objects without having to check their\n",
    "type explicitly. This makes the code more concise and flexible.'''\n",

    "'''Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object or function and exposing its\n",
    "essential functionality. This allows us to focus on how to use the object or function without worrying about how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the key principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP languages, such as Python, use\n",
    "abstraction to create objects that represent real-world entities, such as cars, dogs, and bank accounts. These objects\n",
    "have a set of properties and behaviors that are exposed to the outside world, but the implementation details of those\n",
    "properties and behaviors are hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how abstraction relates to OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Classes and Methods:\n",
    "In Python, you can create abstract classes and methods using the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module. An abstract class\n",
    "is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed. Abstract methods declared within an abstract\n",
    "class are methods without implementations. Subclasses are required to provide concrete implementations for these abstract\n",
    "methods. Abstraction enforces a contract, ensuring that certain methods exist in all subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hiding Implementation Details:\n",
    "Abstraction allows you to hide the internal details and complexities of a class or object. Users of the class interact\n",
    "with it through a well-defined interface (public methods and properties), without needing to understand how those methods\n",
    "are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Encapsulation:\n",
    "Abstraction also involves encapsulating data, which means that data (attributes or properties) within\n",
    "an object should be kept private or protected from direct access. Access to these data members is provided through methods,\n",
    "such as getters and setters, which control how data is retrieved and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability:\n",
    "Abstraction facilitates reusability. Once you've defined an abstract class and its methods, you can create multiple\n",
    "concrete subclasses that implement those methods according to their specific requirements. This promotes code reuse and\n",
    "modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction can be achieved in Python using a variety of techniques, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of binding data and code together into a single unit, such as an object or class. This allows\n",
    "us to hide the implementation details of the data and code from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance is the process of creating a new class that inherits the properties and behaviors of an existing class.\n",
    "This allows us to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes that represent different levels of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. This allows us to write code that is more flexible and\n",
